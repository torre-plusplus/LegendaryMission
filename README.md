The Source Code for Legendary Mission, KS( Hosted at http://legendary-mission-ks.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ )


Legendary Mission is a creative writing endeavor inspired by local legends common in Europe. Hyperbole of kings, ghosts, beheadings, resurrections, lovers and heroes are encouraged. All set in glorious Mission, Kansas.

This project is currently incomplete and still in development. Feedback and pull requests are greatly appreciated. Upon project completion, Legendary Mission will be presented to the Mission City Council and Mission Magazine in an effort to promote localized creative writing and cultural sharing.
