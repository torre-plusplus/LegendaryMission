        <div class="panel-body">
            While traveling in Europe, I was struck with the detail, vividity and extreme exaggeration prevalent in many local legends. Throughout the continent, we heard many fantastic tales of ghosts, giants, heavenly visions and otherworldly happenings. Many were corroborated by seemingly innocuous objects near the setting of the legend. A large tree in Barcelona was a spear that had taken root after being thrown over the city walls by an angered giant. The same tree later hosted a vision of the Virgin Mary, who blessedly supplied military advice to a Catalan commander who'd climbed up to survey an invading army. Unbreakable holy beer steins pay testament to drunkards doing midnight repair work on churches in Munich and a candle-holder in Sevilla bears witness to a king's inebriated crimes. While the truth of these tales could be called into question, their value as entertainment and cultural relevance is formidable. Legendary Mission attempts to bring the same sense of wonder and story-telling to the city of Mission, KS.

        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            Mission, KS has been my home for the past several years. It is a well-organized, peaceful and creative suburb just south of Kansas City. It is best known locally for the charm of the shops on its main street and its avid disapproval of WalMarts. It is a wonderful community, but decidedly not legendary. Yet.
